/**

 * We could not find a sensible way of implementing this in a
 * cross-platform way. For instance, we couldn't hard code the path
 * because some installers allow the user to change the installation
 * directory (such as NSIS on Windows, etc).
 *
 * Instead we are using a basic algorithm. We try to locate a folder
 * called @e data by searching the following places, relative to the
 * location of the binary, in order of precedence:
 *
 * @li the current directory;
 * @li the parent directory;
 * @li a sub-folder called @e share in the parent directory;
 * @li a sub-folder called @e share/neurite-VERSION in the parent
 * directory, where @e VERSION is the current neurite version;
 * @li a sub-folder called @e share/neurite in the parent directory;
 *
 * If the folder is not found, the function throws an exception.
