This document contains the product backlog for Neurite.

** In next few sprints

*** Add version support to soma                                       :story:

We need to know the version and commit of the application on the log file.

*** Fix Qt warnings about TopLevelScreen                              :story:

At present when we exit soma we see loads of these:

: a0xb02190 void QWindowPrivate::setTopLevelScreen(QScreen*, bool) ( QScreen(0xa66d40) ): Attempt to set a screen on a child window.
: 0xc3aec0 void QWindowPrivate::setTopLevelScreen(QScreen*, bool) ( QScreen(0xa66d40) ): Attempt to set a screen on a child window.
: 0xc623c0 void QWindowPrivate::setTopLevelScreen(QScreen*, bool) ( QScreen(0xa66d40) ): Attempt to set a screen on a child window.
: 0xc4de30 void QWindowPrivate::setTopLevelScreen(QScreen*, bool) ( QScreen(0xa66d40) ): Attempt to set a screen on a child window.

Apparently this is due to a bug in Qt:

[[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33545006/qt5-attempt-to-set-a-screen-on-a-child-window-many-runtime-warning-messages][Qt5 “Attempt to set a screen on a child window” many runtime warning messages]]

** Tooling, infrastructure, blog posts, etc.
** Visionary work and random ideas
