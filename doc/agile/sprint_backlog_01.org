    CLOCK: [2015-09-03 Thu 07:51]--[2015-09-03 Thu 08:05] =>  0:14

Updates to sprint and product backlog.

*** COMPLETED Write post on C++ implementation of Ohm's Law           :story:
    CLOSED: [2015-09-05 Sat 18:48]
    CLOCK: [2015-09-03 Thu 08:05]--[2015-09-05 Sat 18:48] => 58:43

Create a simple post describing the code for Ohm's Law.

*** COMPLETED Write a post on Capacitors and RC Circuits              :story:
    CLOSED: [2015-09-05 Sat 18:48]
    CLOCK: [2015-09-05 Sat 15:01]--[2015-09-05 Sat 18:48] =>  3:47

Finish up the post on RC Circuits, with possibly a link back to
neurons.

*** Write a post on more advanced neuron morphology                   :story:

We need to start talking about:

- high-level: mylin sheath, axon hillock, etc.
- lower level:
  - compartments
  - concentration gradient, voltage
  - ions: channels and pumps

*** Implement the capacitor's current differential equation in C++    :story:

We need to use odeint. We need to write a blog post describing it.
