#+title: Nerd Food: Neurons for Computer Geeks - Part I
#+options: date:nil toc:nil author:nil num:nil title:nil

As any computer geek would tell you, computer science is great in and
of itself and many of us could live long and contented lives inside
that box. But things certainly tend to become interesting when there
is a whole problem domain to model, and doubly so when that domain is
outside of our comfort zone. As it happens, I have managed to step
outside said zone - rather, quite far outside - so it seemed like a
good idea to chronicle these adventures here.

The journey we are about to embark starts with a deceptively simple
mission: to understand how one can use computers to model neurons. The
intended audience of these posts is anyone who loves coding but has no
idea about electricity, circuits, cells and so on - basically someone
very much like me. We shall try to explain, at least to a degree, all
of the required core concepts in order to start coding. As it turns
out, there are quite a few.

But hey, as [[http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/8742/did-einstein-say-if-you-cant-explain-it-simply-you-dont-understand-it-well-en][they say]], "If you can't explain something to a six
year-old, you really don't understand it yourself". So lets see if I
got it or not.

* Neuron from up on high

A neuron is a _cell_, so it makes sense to start with cells. Cells are
a basic building block in biology and can be considered as the
smallest unit of a living organism - at least for our purposes, if
nothing else. The key idea behind a cell is as obvious as you'd like:
there is the inside, the outside, and the thing that separates
both. Of course, this being biology, we need to give it complicated
names. Accordingly, the inside of the cell is the _cytoplasm_ and the
thing that separates the cell from the outside world is the
_membrane_. You can think of it as a _tiny_ roundy-box-like thing,
with some gooey stuff inside. The material of the box is the
membrane. The gooey stuff is the cytoplasm.

Living beings are made up of many, many cells - according to some
estimates, a human body would have several trillion - and cells
themselves come in many, _many_ kinds. Fortunately, we are interested
in just one kind: the _neuron_. A neuron is a nerve cell. There are
many, many kinds of neurons too, but they all share some basic things
in common - their neuron-ness, if you like. When we start describing
the different cellular structures, their interconnections and so on,
we are talking about cell _morphology_.

Unlike the "typical" cell we described above (i.e. "roundy-box-like
thing"), the neuron is more like a roundy-box-like thing with some
branches coming out of it. The box-like thing is the cell body and is
called _soma_. There are two types of branches: axons and dendrites. A
_dendrite_ tends to be short, and it branches like a tree with a very
small trunk. The _axon_ tends to be long and it also branches off like
a tree, but with a very long trunk. As we said, there are many kinds
of neurons, but a fair generalisation is that they tend to have few
axons (one or maybe a couple) and many dendrites (in the thousands).

This very basic morphology is already sufficient to allows to start to
think of a neuron as a "computing device" - a strange kind of device
where the dendrites provide inputs and the axon outputs. The neuron
receives all these inputs, performs some kind of computation over
them, and produces an output.

The next logical question for a computer science is then, where do the
outputs come from and where do they go. Imagining an idealised neuron,
the dendrites would be "connecting" to other dendrites or to axons. At
this juncture (pun not intended), we need to expand on what exactly
these "connections" are. In truth, its not that the axon binds
directly to the dendrite; there is always a gap between them. But this
gap is a special kind of gap, first because it is a very small gap and
second because it is one over which things can travel, from the axon
into the dendrite. This kind of connectivity between neurons is called
a _synapse_.

From this it is an easy leap to imagine that these sets of neurons
connected to other neurons begin to form "networks" of connectivity,
and these networks will also have computational-device-like
properties, just like a neuron. These are called _neural
networks_. Our brain happens to be one of these "neural networks", and
a pretty large one at that: it can have [[http://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/brain-metrics/are_there_really_as_many][as many as 80-100 billion
neurons]], connected over some 1 quadrillion synapses. In these days of
financial billions and trillions, it is easy to be fooled into
thinking 100 billion is not a very large number, so get a sense of
perspective lets compare it to another large network. The biggest and
fasted growing human-made network is the Internet, estimated to have
[[http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2905717][some 5 billion connected devices]] but yet less than [[http://bgp.potaroo.net/][600k connections in
its core]] - and yet we are already [[http://research.dyn.com/2014/08/internet-512k-global-routes/][creacking at the seams]].

* A Large Detour Over Very, _Very_ Small Things

Alas, we must dig deeper before we start to understand how these
things behave in groups. Our skimpy first pass at the neuron
morphology left a lot of details out, which are required to understand
how they behave. As we explained, neurons have axons and dendrites,
and these are responsible for hooking them together. However, what is
interesting is what they talk about once they are hooked.

A neuron is can be thought of as an _electrical device_, and much of
its power (sorry!) stems from this. In general, as computer
scientists, we don't like to get too close to the physical messiness
of the world of hardware; we deem it sufficient to understand some
high-level properties, but rarely do we want to concern ourselves with
transistors or even - regrettably - registers or pipelines in the
CPU. With neurons, we can't get away with it. We need to understand
the hardware - or better, the wetware - and for that we have to go
_very_ low-level.

We started off by saying cells have a membrane that separates the
outside world from the cytoplasm. That was a tad of an
oversimplification; after all, if the membrane did not allow anything
in, how would the cell continue to exist - or even come about in the
first place? In practice these membranes are permeable - or to be
precise, _semi-permeable_. This just means that it allows some stuff
in and some stuff out, under controlled circumstances. This is how a
cell gets energy _in_ to do its thing and how it expels its unwanted
content _out_. Once things started to move in and out selectively,
something very interesting can start to happen: the build up of
"electric potential". However, rather unfortunately, in order to
understand what we mean by this, we need to cover the fundamentals of
electricity. If you are an electricity nerd, I apologise in advance;
this is what happens when a computer scientist escapes into your
realm, I'm afraid.

Onwards and downwards we march.

** "Honor the charge they made!"

First we need to understand the concept of _charge_. It is almost a
tautology that atoms are made up of "sub-atomic" particles. These are
the _proton_, the _neutron_ and the _electron_. The neutron is not
particularly interesting for our purposes; however the electron and
the proton are, and all because they have a magical property called
_charge_. For our purposes, it suffices to know that charge means they
attract or repeal each other. You can think of a charge as an
arbitrary number attached to the sub-atomic particle, very much like a
person has a weight or height, but with the side-effect that makes
people push or hug each other when they are in close proximity. It
just happens that all people push or hug each other with the same
strength when they are at the same distance. This "strength" is the
_electric force_. How they decide whether to hug or push the next guy
is based on the "sign" of the charge - that is, positive or negative -
with respect to their own charge "sign". Positives push positives away
but hug negatives and vice-versa.

For whatever historical reasons, very clever people decided that an
electron has one negative unit of charge and a proton has a positive
unit of charge. The sign is, of course, rather arbitrary. We could
have just as well said that protons are red and electrons are blue or
some other suitably binary-like convention to represent these
permutations. Also, just because protons and electrons have the same
charge, it does not follow that they are similar in other respects. In
fact, they are very different creatures. For example, the electron is
very "small" when compared to the proton - almost 2000 times
"smaller". The relevance of this "size" difference will become
apparent later on.

As it happens, all of these sub-atomic crazy critters are rather
minute entities. So small in fact that it would be really cumbersome
if we had to talk about charges in terms of the charge of an electron;
the numbers would just be too big and unwieldy. So, the very clever
people came up with a sensible way to bundle up the charges of the
sub-atomic particles in bigger numbers, much like we don't talk about
millimetres when measuring the distance to the Moon. However, unlike
the nice and logical metric system, with its neat use of the decimal
system, physicists came up instead with the _Coulomb_, or _C_, one
definition of which is:

- 1 Coloumb (1C) = 6.241 x 10^18 protons
- -1 Coloumb (-1C) = 6.241 x 10^18 electrons

This may sound like a _very_ odd choice - hey, why not just 1 x 10^20
or some other "round" number? - but just like a [[http://www.quora.com/Why-is-a-kilogram-equal-to-1000-grams-but-a-kilobyte-equals-1024-bytes][kilobyte is 1024 bytes
rather 1000]], this it wasn't done by accident either. In fact, all
related [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units][SI units]] were carefuly designed to work together and make
calculations as easy as possible.

Anyway, whenever you see =q= or =Q= in formulas it normally refers to
a charge in Coulombs.

** Units, Dimensions, Measures, Oh My!

Since we are on the subject of SI, this is probably a good point to
talk about units, dimensions, measurements, magnitudes and conversions
and other such exciting topics. Unfortunately, these are important to
understand how it all hangs together.

A number such as =1A= makes use of the SI _unit of measure_ "Ampere"
and it exists in a _dimension_: the dimension of all units which can
talk about electric charges. This is very much in the same way we can
talk about time in seconds or minutes - we are describing points in
the time dimension, but using different _units of measure_ - or just
_units_, because we're lazy. A _measurement_ is the recording of a
quantity with a unit in a dimension. Of course, it would be too simple
to call it a "quantity", so instead physicists, mathematicians and the
like call it _magnitude_. But for the lay person, its not too bad an
approximation to replace "magnitude" with "quantity".

Finally, it is entirely possible to have _compound dimensional units_;
that is, one can have a unit of measure that refers to more than one
dimension, such as say "10 kilometres per second".

I won't discuss conversions just now, but you can easily imagine that
formulas that contain multiple units may provide "bridges" to convert
from one unit to another. This will become relevant later on.

** Go With the Flow

Now we have a way of talking about charge, and now we know these
things can move (since they attract and repel each other), the next
logical thing is to start to imagine _current_. The name sounds
magical, but in reality it is akin to a current in a river: you are
just trying to figure out how much water is coming past you every
second (or some other suitable unit in the time dimension). The exact
same exercise could be repeated for the number of cars going past in a
motorway or the number of runners across some imaginary point in a
track. For our electric purposes, current tells you how many charges
have zipped past over a period of time.

In terms of SI units, current is measured in _Amperes_, which have the
symbol _A_; an Ampere tells us how many Coloumbs have flown past in a
second. Whenever you see =I= in formulas it normally refers to
current.

Now lets see how these two things - Coulombs and Amperes - could work
together. Lets imagine an arbitrary "pipe" between two imaginary
locations, one side of which with a pile of positive charges and the
other side of which with a pile of negative charges (both measured in
Coulombs, naturally). In this _extraordinarily_ simplified and
non-existing world, the negative charges would "flow" down the pipe,
attracted by the positive charges. Because the positive charges are so
huge they won't budge, but the negative charges - the lighter
electrons - would zip across to meet them. The number of charges you
see going past is the current.

** Resist!

Going back to our example of current in a river, one can imagine that
some surfaces are better at allowing water to flow than others; for
example, a river out in the open is a lot less "efficient" at flowing
than say a plastic pipe designed for that purpose. One reason is that
the river has to deal with twists and turns as it finds a path over
the landscape whereas the pipe could be laid out as straight as
possible; but it is also that the rocks and other elements of the
landscape slow down water, whereas a nice flat pipe would have no such
impediments. If one were to take these two extremes - a plastic pipe
designed for maximum water flow versus a landscape - one could see
that they affect flow differently; and one could be tempted to name
the property of "slowing down the flow" _resistance_, because it
describes how much "resistance" these things are offering to the
water. If you put up a barrier to avoid flooding, you probably would
want it to "resist" water quite a lot rather than allow it to flow;
and you can easily imagine that sand and sandbags "resist" water in
very different ways.

Resistance is a fundamental concept in the electrical world. The gist
of it is similar to the contrived examples above, in that not all
materials behave the same way with regards to allowing charges to
flow. Some allow them to flow freely nearly at maximum speed whereas
others do not allow them to flow at all.

Since we are dealing with physics, it is of course possible to measure
resistance. We do so in SI units of _Ohms_, denoted by the Greek
letter upper-case Omega.

As we shall see, not all materials are nicely behaved when it comes to
resistance.

** You've Got Potential Baby!

Lets return to our non-existing "pipe that allows charges to flow"
scenario, and take it one step further. Imagine that for whatever
reason our pipe becomes clogged up with a blockage somewhere in the
middle. Nothing could actually flow due to this blockage so our
current drops to zero.

According to the highly simplified rules that we have learned thus
far, we do know that - were there to be no blockage - there _would_ be
movement (current). That is, the setup of the two bundles in space is
such that, given the right conditions, we would start to see things
flowing. But, alas, we do not have the right conditions because the
pipe is blocked; hence no flow. You could say this setup has "the
potential" to get some flow going, if only we could fix the blockage.

In the world of electricity, this idea is captured by a few related
concepts. If we highly simplify them, they amount to this:

- _electric potential_: the idea that depending where you place a
  charge in space, it may have different "potential" to generate
  energy. We'll define energy a bit better latter on, but for now a
  layman's idea of it suffices. By way of a contrived example: if you
  place a positive charge next to a lump of positive charges and let
  it go, it will move a certain distance away from the lump. Before
  you let the charge go, you know the charge has potential to move
  away. You can also see that the charge will move by different
  amounts depending how close you place it to the lump; the closer you
  place it, the more it will move. When we are thinking of electric
  potential, we think of just one charge.
- _electric potential energy_: clearly it would be possible to move
  two or three charges too; and clearly they should produce more
  energy then a single charge. For now we will just define electric
  potential energy in exactly the same way as we defied electric
  potential - but dealing with the total number of charges we're
  interested in, rather than just one.

One way of imagining these two concepts is to think that electric
potential is a good way to measure things when you don't particularly
care about the number of charges involved; it is as if you scaled
everything to just one unit of charge. Electric potential energy is
more when you are thinking of a system with an actual number of
charges.

Having said all of that we can now start to think about _electric
potential difference_. It uses the same approach as electric
potential, in that everything is scaled to just one unit of charge,
but as the name implies, it provides a measurement of _the difference_
between the electric potential of two points. Electric potential
difference is more commonly known as _voltage_. It is also known as
_electric pressure_, because it is akin to a pressure being exerted to
charges.

The SI unit _Volt_ is used to measure electric potential, electric
potential energy and electric potential difference - amongst other
things. This may sound a bit weird at first, but it is just because
one is unfamiliar with these concepts. Take time for example: we use
minutes as a unit of measure of all sorts of things (duration of a
football game, time it takes for the moon to go around the earth,
etc.). We did not invent a new unit for each phenomenon because we
recognised - at some point - that we were dealing with points in the
same dimension.

** Quick Conceptual Mop-Up

Before we move over to the formulas, it may be best to tie up a few
loose ends. These are not strictly necessary, but just make the
picture a bit more complete and moves us to a more realistic model -
if still very simplistic.

First, we should start with atoms; we mentioned charges but skipped
them. Atoms are (mostly) a stable arrangement of charges, placed in
such a way that the atoms themselves are neutral - i.e. contain
exactly the same amount of negative and positive charges. We mentioned
before that protons and electrons don't really get along, and neutrons
are kind of just there, hanging around. In truth, neutrons and protons
also really get along, via the aptly named _nuclear force_; this is
what binds them together in the nucleus of the atom. Electrons are
attracted to protons and live their existences in a "cloud" around the
nucleus. Note that the nucleus is more than 99% of the mass of the
atom, which gives you an idea of just how small electrons are.

The materials we will deal with in our examples are made of atoms, as
are, well, quite a few things in the universe. These materials are
themselves stable arrangements of atoms, just like atoms are stable
arrangements of protons, neutrons and electrons. As you can see in the
picture, these look like lattices of some kind.

In practice, copper wires are made up of a great many things rather
than just atoms of copper. One such "kind of thing" is the _unbound
electrons_ - or free-moving electrons; basically electrons are not
trapped into an atom. As we mentioned before, electrons are the ones
doing most of the moving. Left to their own devices, electrons in a
conducting material will just move around, bumping into atoms in a
fairly random way. However, lets say you take one end of a copper wire
and plug it to the =+= side of a regular AA battery and then take
other end and plug it to the =-= side of the battery. According to all
we've just learned, its easy to imagine what will happen: the
electrons stored in the =-= side will zip across the copper to meet
their proton friends at the other end. This elemental construction,
with its circular path, is called a _circuit_. What you've done is to
upset the neutral balance of the copper wire and got all the electrons
to move in a coordinated way (rather than random) from the =-= side to
the =+= side.

One final word on resistance and its sister concept of _conductance_:

- _Resistance_ is in effect a byproduct of the way the electrons are
  arranged in the electron cloud[fn:1]; certain arrangements just
  don't allow electrons to flow across;
- _Conductance_ is the inverse of resistance. When you talk about
  resistance you are focusing on the material's ability to impair
  movement of charges; when you talk about conductance you are
  focusing on the material's ability to let charge flow through.

The reason we choose copper or other metals for our examples is
because they are good at _conducting_ these pesky electrons.

** The First Formula: Ohm's Law

We have now introduced all the main actors required for one of the
main parts in the play: Ohm's Law. It can be stated very easily:

: V = R x I

And here's a picture to aid intuition.

#+CAPTION: Source: [[http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/161650/could-someone-intuitively-explain-to-me-ohms-law][Could someone intuitively explain to me Ohm's law?]]
http://i.stack.imgur.com/4KhUg.jpg

The best way to understand this law is to create a simple circuit. On
the left we have a voltage source, which could be our 1.5V AA
battery. On the right of the diagram we have a _resistor_ - an
electric component that is designed specifically to "control" the flow
of the electric current. Without the resistor, we would be limited by
how much current the battery can pump out and how much "natural"
resistance the copper wire has, which is not a lot since it is very
good at conducting. The resistor gives us a way to limit current flow
from these theoretical maximum limitations.

Assuming a typical battery with 1.5V,
