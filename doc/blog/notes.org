Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model Neuron



1. explain why capacitance is constant.
2. explain that capacitors current makes use of the first derivative
   of the voltage. explain the differences between instantaneous
   current and current.
3. explain the derivation from capacitor's current to RC circuit's
   voltage.
